# Programming Caesar's Cipher
This program is very similar in purpose to the Cipher Usability program. The only main difference between the two is that this program asks for a user input only in capital letters while the Cipher Usability program asks for an input that can contain anything from capital letters to punctuation to miscellaneous characters. This program was made before I moved on to the Cipher Usability program and thus is different in that it is not as developed as the Cipher Usability program. 


### Project
This project:
- Shares an opening message with the user that describes what the program will do.
- Gets the user input (only capital letters), the key, and the mode (encrypt or decrypt).
- Gives back the final message.
